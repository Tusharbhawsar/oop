    "What is a Process?\n",
    "A process is an executing program with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Program code (instructions to run)\n",
    "Data (variables, buffers, workspace)\n",
    "Execution context (state of the process)\n",
    "What is a Thread?\n",
    "A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process can have multiple threads.\n",
    "Threads share the same code and global data but have their own registers and local variables (stack).\n",
    "Think of a thread as a lightweight subprocess.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Multithreading Works\n",
    "On single-core CPUs, Python achieves concurrency using context switching (frequent switching between threads).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes threads appear to run in parallel (multitasking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple threads help in performing background tasks without blocking the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-threaded process executes only one task at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multithreaded process can run multiple tasks in parallel by having separate stacks/registers for each thread, but sharing the same code and data."
