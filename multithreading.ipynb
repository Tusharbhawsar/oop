    "A process is an executing program with:\n",

    "A process can have multiple threads.\n",

    "How Multithreading Works\n",
    "On single-core CPUs, Python achieves concurrency using context switching (frequent switching between threads).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes threads appear to run in parallel (multitasking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple threads help in performing background tasks without blocking the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-threaded process executes only one task at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multithreaded process can run multiple tasks in parallel by having separate stacks/registers for each thread, but sharing the same code and data."
